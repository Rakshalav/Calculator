This is my first ever C++ project — a fully functional GUI calculator built using wxWidgets. It features a clean layout, keyboard input support, expression parsing, and custom button logic.

Features:
  Standard calculator operations
  Keyboard + button input support
  Custom expression evaluator
  Panel-based UI (future support for scientific modes)
  Input validation + error handling (syntax, divide-by-zero, etc.)

Built With:
  C++23
  wxWidgets — cross-platform GUI framework

Requirements:
  C++ compiler (MSVC, g++, Clang, etc.)
  wxWidgets library (setup instructions below)

How to Build
  Download the Solution.
  Clone or download the repository.
  Open the solution file in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
  If using Visual Studio, simply build and run.
  If using other IDEs, ensure wxWidgets is properly set up as a dependency.

Platforms
  This project works perfectly on Windows 11.
  It has not been tested on MacOS or Linux yet, but it should be cross-platform compatible with the right wxWidgets configuration.

Known Limitations
  Only standard mode implemented so far.
  Expression logic may need refinement for edge cases.
  No history or memory storage yet.

Future Plans
  Add scientific mode (trig, log, factorial, etc.), most types of converters, and a simple graphing tool like GeoGebra.
  Implement theme switcher (light/dark).
  Add calculation history.
  Add configurable keyboard shortcuts.
